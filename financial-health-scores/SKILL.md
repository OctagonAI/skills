## Altman Z-Score Interpretation

The Altman Z-Score predicts bankruptcy probability:

| Z-Score Range | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| > 3.0 | Safe Zone - Low bankruptcy risk |
| 1.8 - 3.0 | Grey Zone - Moderate risk, needs monitoring |
| < 1.8 | Distress Zone - High bankruptcy risk |

### Z-Score Formula
```
Z = 1.2(WC/TA) + 1.4(RE/TA) + 3.3(EBIT/TA) + 0.6(MC/TL) + 1.0(Rev/TA)
```
Where:
- WC = Working Capital
- TA = Total Assets
- RE = Retained Earnings
- EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
- MC = Market Cap
- TL = Total Liabilities
- Rev = Revenue

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 8-9 | Strong - High quality value stock |
| 5-7 | Moderate - Average financial health |
| 0-4 | Weak - Poor financial health |
