## Analyzing Financial Guidance

### Revenue Guidance

| Guidance Type | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Point estimate | High confidence, narrow range |
| Percentage range | Normal uncertainty |
| Directional only | Low visibility, high uncertainty |
| Quarterly vs. annual | Different confidence levels |

### Calculating Implied Growth

```
Implied Growth = (Midpoint of Guidance / Prior Year Actual) - 1

Example:
- Q1 2026 Guidance: $95B - $98B (midpoint: $96.5B)
- Q1 2025 Actual: $85B
- Implied Growth: ($96.5B / $85B) - 1 = 13.5%
```

### Margin Guidance Analysis

| Margin Movement | Potential Drivers |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Expanding | Pricing power, cost cuts, mix shift |
| Stable | Mature business, balanced investments |
