# Interpreting Income Statement Growth

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year | Revenue Growth (%) | Gross Profit Growth (%) | Operating Income Growth (%) | Net Income Growth (%) | EPS Diluted Growth (%) |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 2025 | 6.43 | 8.04 | 7.98 | 19.50 | 22.70 |

**Positive values** = Growth vs prior year
**Negative values** = Decline vs prior year

## Key Patterns

### Operating Leverage
When Operating Income Growth > Revenue Growth:
- Fixed costs spread over larger revenue base
- Scalable business model

### Margin Expansion
When Gross Profit Growth > Revenue Growth:
- Pricing power or cost efficiencies
- Improved product mix

### Share Buyback Signal
When EPS Growth > Net Income Growth:
- Company reducing share count
- Capital return to shareholders

### Profitability Acceleration
When Net Income Growth > Operating Income Growth > Revenue Growth:
- All metrics improving
- Strong execution

## Red Flags

1. **Revenue declining, EPS rising**: Unsustainable financial engineering
2. **Gross Profit lagging Revenue**: Margin compression
3. **Operating Income negative while others positive**: Cost control issues
4. **High volatility year-over-year**: Inconsistent execution

## Generating Observations

After receiving data, note:

1. Which year showed strongest overall performance?
2. Are there divergences between top-line and bottom-line growth?
3. Is EPS growth driven by earnings or buybacks?
4. Any multi-year trends (acceleration/deceleration)?
