# Interpreting Cash Flow Statement Results

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year | Net Income (USD) | Operating Cash Flow (USD) | Investing Cash Flow (USD) | Financing Cash Flow (USD) | Free Cash Flow (USD) | Net Change in Cash (USD) | Cash at End of Period (USD) |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 2025 | $112.01B | $111.48B | $15.19B | -$120.69B | $98.77B | $5.99B | $35.93B |

Values are in absolute USD for the fiscal period. Negative values indicate cash outflows.

## Key Calculations

### Cash Conversion Ratio
```
Cash Conversion = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income
```
Example: $111.48B / $112.01B = 0.995 (nearly 100% conversion)

### Capital Expenditures
```
Capex = Operating Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow
```
Example: $111.48B - $98.77B = $12.71B

### Cash Flow Check
```
Net Change = Operating + Investing + Financing
```
Should equal Net Change in Cash (+ FX effects)

### Free Cash Flow Yield
```
FCF Yield = Free Cash Flow / Market Cap × 100
```
Compare to peers and cost of equity

## Key Patterns

### Strong Cash Generation
- OCF consistently exceeds Net Income
- FCF covers all shareholder returns
- Ending cash stable or growing

### Aggressive Capital Return
- Large financing outflows
- Buybacks and dividends > FCF
- May use debt or cash reserves

### Growth Investment
- Negative investing cash flow
- Capex elevated vs historical
- Expansion or capacity building

### Mature Cash Cow
- High OCF relative to capex
- Large FCF generation
- Focus on shareholder returns

## Three Cash Flow Categories

## Warning Signs

1. **OCF < Net Income persistently**: Earnings quality concern
2. **FCF negative multiple years**: Unsustainable if not growth phase
3. **Cash declining while financing outflows continue**: Depleting reserves
4. **Large investing inflows**: Could signal asset sales to fund operations
