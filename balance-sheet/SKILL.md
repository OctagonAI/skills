## Key Observations Pattern

After receiving data, generate observations:

1. **Asset base changes**: Track total assets trajectory over time
2. **Asset composition**: Analyze current vs non-current asset mix
3. **Equity trends**: Monitor shareholders' equity changes
4. **Leverage position**: Track net debt levels and direction
5. **Capital structure**: Compare liabilities to equity ratios

## Metrics Reference

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Total Assets | All resources owned by the company |
| Total Current Assets | Assets convertible to cash within 1 year |
| Total Non-Current Assets | Long-term assets (PP&E, intangibles, investments) |
| Total Liabilities | All obligations and debts |
| Total Equity | Net worth (Assets - Liabilities) |
| Net Debt | Total debt minus cash and equivalents |

## Analysis Tips

### Asset Composition
- Current Assets: Liquidity and working capital
- Non-Current Assets: Long-term investments and capacity
- Shift toward current = more liquid
- Shift toward non-current = more invested

### Capital Structure Ratios
Calculate from the data:
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Equity
Equity Ratio = Total Equity / Total Assets
```

### Net Debt Analysis
- Declining Net Debt = deleveraging
- Negative Net Debt = net cash position
- Compare to EBITDA for leverage context

### Equity Trends
Rising equity from:
- Retained earnings (profitable operations)
- Stock issuance
- Other comprehensive income

Declining equity from:
- Net losses
- Share buybacks
- Dividends exceeding earnings

### Working Capital
```
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
```
Positive = can meet short-term obligations

## Follow-up Queries

Based on results, suggest deeper analysis:

- "What factors contributed to the decline in total assets in [YEAR] compared to [PRIOR YEAR]?"
- "How has [COMPANY]'s capital allocation strategy evolved between [YEAR1] and [YEAR2]?"
- "What specific components of non-current assets grew between [YEAR1] and [YEAR2]?"
- "Compare [COMPANY]'s leverage ratios to [PEER1] and [PEER2]"
