|---------|---------|--------|------------------|--------|
| Segment A | $X | Y% | $Z | W% |

**Key Trends:**
- Growth leaders
- Margin analysis
- Notable changes

## Understanding Segment Composition

### Segment Types

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Operating Segment | Business unit reviewed by CODM |
| Reportable Segment | Meets materiality thresholds |
| Geographic Segment | Revenue/assets by location |
| All Other | Below-threshold segments |

### Materiality Thresholds

Segment is reportable if:
- Revenue ≥ 10% of total
- Profit/Loss ≥ 10% of combined
- Assets ≥ 10% of total
- Or management chooses to disclose

## Evaluating Segment Revenue

### Size Analysis

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| Absolute Revenue | Segment scale |

| Growth Rate | Momentum |
| Trend | Direction over time |

### Revenue Quality

| Factor | Strong | Weak |
|--------|--------|------|
| Growth | Accelerating | Decelerating |
| Consistency | Stable | Volatile |
| Diversification | Balanced | Concentrated |
| Recurring | High repeat | One-time |

## Evaluating Segment Profitability

### Margin Analysis

| Margin Level | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| >40% | Premium, differentiated |
| 25-40% | Strong, healthy |
| 15-25% | Moderate, competitive |
| 5-15% | Low, scale-dependent |
| <5% | Thin, commodity-like |

### Margin Quality

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Stability | Consistent vs. volatile |
| Trend | Improving vs. declining |
| vs. Peers | Above/below industry |

## Analyzing Segment Mix

### Mix Shift Analysis

| Shift Type | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| Toward high-margin | Improving quality |
| Toward low-margin | Margin pressure |
| Toward high-growth | Growth focus |
| Toward stable | Defensive positioning |

### Diversification Assessment

| Concentration | Risk Level |
|---------------|------------|
| Top segment >50% | High |
| Top segment 30-50% | Moderate |
| Balanced (<30% each) | Low |

## Geographic Segment Analysis

### Regional Performance

| Region | What to Assess |
|--------|----------------|
| Domestic | Core market health |
| International | Expansion progress |
| Emerging | Growth potential |
| Developed | Stability |

### Geographic Considerations

## Tracking Segment Changes

### Types of Restructuring

| Change | Possible Reason |
|--------|-----------------|
| New Segment | Acquisition, growth area |
| Removed Segment | Divestiture, decline |
| Combined | Simplification, hiding |
| Split | More transparency |
| Renamed | Strategy repositioning |

### Assessing Restructuring

| Question | What to Consider |
|----------|------------------|
| Why now? | Timing, context |

| Pattern | Frequent changes? |

## Historical Comparison

### Period-over-Period

| Metric | Prior | Current | Change |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | | | |
| Growth | | | |
| Margin | | | |
| Mix | | | |

### Trend Analysis

Track over multiple periods:
- Revenue trajectory
- Margin evolution
- Mix shifts
- Investment patterns

## Red Flags in Segment Reporting

### Revenue Red Flags

1. **Declining core segment** - Business deterioration
2. **Volatile performance** - Unstable operations
3. **Intersegment reliance** - Internal sales dependency
4. **Concentration** - Single segment dominance

### Profitability Red Flags

1. **Margin compression** - Competitive pressure
2. **Unprofitable segment** - Cash drain
3. **Diverging margins** - Subsidy between segments
4. **Declining contribution** - Weakening profit source

### Disclosure Red Flags

1. **Frequent restructuring** - May obscure trends
2. **Reduced disclosure** - Less transparency
3. **Changed metrics** - Different KPIs
4. **Vague explanations** - Unclear drivers

## Sum-of-Parts Valuation

### Methodology

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Identify comparable for each segment |
| 2 | Apply relevant multiple to each |
| 3 | Sum segment values |
| 4 | Adjust for corporate costs |
| 5 | Add cash, subtract debt |

### Multiple Selection

| Segment Type | Common Multiple |
|--------------|-----------------|
| High growth | Revenue multiple |
| Mature, profitable | EBITDA multiple |
| Asset-heavy | Book value |
| Declining | Discount to peers |

## Peer Comparison Framework

### Cross-Company Analysis

| Company | Segment A Revenue | Margin | Growth |
|---------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Company X | | | |
| Company Y | | | |
| Company Z | | | |

### Considerations

| Factor | Why It Matters |

| Definition | Segments may differ |
| Allocation | Cost treatment varies |
| Scale | Size affects margins |
| Strategy | Different priorities |

## Using Results for Analysis

### Investment Implications

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Strong segment growing | Positive catalyst |
| Weak segment improving | Turnaround potential |
| Core segment declining | Structural concern |
