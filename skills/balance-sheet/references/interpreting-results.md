# Interpreting Balance Sheet Results

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year | Total Assets (USD) | Total Current Assets (USD) | Total Non-Current Assets (USD) | Total Liabilities (USD) | Total Equity (USD) | Net Debt (USD) |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2025 | 359,241.00 million | 147,957.00 million | 211,284.00 million | 285,508.00 million | 73,733.00 million | 89,749.00 million |

Values are in absolute USD (millions) at fiscal period end.

## Key Calculations

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
```
D/E = Total Liabilities / Total Equity
```
Example: $285.5B / $73.7B = 3.87x

### Equity Ratio
```
Equity Ratio = Total Equity / Total Assets × 100
```
Example: $73.7B / $359.2B = 20.5%

### Current Ratio (if current liabilities available)
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```
Above 1.0 = can cover short-term obligations

### Net Debt to Equity
```
Net Debt / Equity = Net Debt / Total Equity
```
Example: $89.7B / $73.7B = 1.22x

## Key Patterns

### Strengthening Balance Sheet
- Total Equity increasing
- Net Debt decreasing
- Debt-to-Equity ratio declining

### Leveraging Up
- Liabilities growing faster than assets
- Net Debt increasing
- Equity ratio declining

### Asset-Light Model
- Lower non-current assets relative to revenue
- Higher asset turnover
- Less capital intensive

### Cash-Rich Position
- Negative Net Debt (cash exceeds debt)
- Strong liquidity
- Flexibility for M&A, buybacks

## Component Analysis

### Current Assets
Includes:
- Cash and equivalents
- Short-term investments
- Accounts receivable
- Inventory

### Non-Current Assets

### Understanding Net Debt
```
Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents
```
- Positive = net debtor
- Negative = net cash position

## Comparative Analysis

### Peer Benchmarking
Compare:
- Debt-to-Equity vs industry average
- Equity ratio vs competitors
- Net Debt / EBITDA for leverage

### Historical Trend
Track over time:
- Is leverage increasing or decreasing?
- Is equity growing from operations?
- Is asset base expanding efficiently?
