# Interpreting Analyst Estimates Results

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year Ending | Revenue Estimate (Low to High) | Revenue Avg | EPS Estimate (Low to High) | EPS Avg | # Revenue Analysts | # EPS Analysts |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2030-09-27 | $540.64B - $600.88B | $566.24B | $12.01 - $13.78 | $12.77 | 9 | 6 |

- **Revenue Avg**: Consensus average of all analyst estimates
- **Low to High**: Range showing dispersion of estimates
- **# Analysts**: Coverage depth for each metric

## Key Calculations

### Implied Growth Rate
```
Revenue CAGR = (Future Revenue / Current Revenue)^(1/Years) - 1
EPS CAGR = (Future EPS / Current EPS)^(1/Years) - 1
```

### Estimate Dispersion
```
Dispersion % = (High - Low) / Average × 100
```
- <10% = Tight consensus
- 10-20% = Moderate uncertainty
- >20% = Wide disagreement

### Forward Multiples
```
Forward P/E = Current Stock Price / EPS Estimate
Forward P/S = Market Cap / Revenue Estimate
```

### PEG Ratio
```
PEG = Forward P/E / EPS Growth Rate
```
- PEG < 1 = Potentially undervalued
- PEG > 2 = Potentially expensive

## Key Patterns

### Accelerating Growth
When growth rates increase in outer years:
- Analysts expect business momentum
- New product cycles anticipated
- Market expansion expected

### Decelerating Growth
When growth rates slow in outer years:
- Law of large numbers
- Market saturation concerns
- Maturing business model

### Widening Dispersion
Increasing range in outer years:
- Normal uncertainty increase
- But watch for unusually wide spreads
- May indicate structural uncertainty

### Declining Coverage
Fewer analysts in outer years:
- Normal for distant periods
- Concern if near-term coverage dropping
- May signal waning institutional interest

## Analyst Coverage Quality

### Strong Coverage
- 20+ analysts = well-covered large cap
- Tight dispersion = high consensus
- Regular estimate updates

### Weak Coverage
- <5 analysts = thin coverage
- Wide dispersion = low consensus
- Infrequent updates

## Estimate Reliability by Timeframe

### Near-term (1-2 years)
- Highest reliability
- Most analysts participate
- Informed by management guidance
- Tightest dispersion

### Medium-term (3-4 years)
- Moderate reliability
- Fewer analysts venture estimates
- Based on strategic assumptions
- Wider dispersion acceptable

### Long-term (5+ years)
- Lowest reliability
- Fewest analysts participate
- Highly speculative
- Use with significant caution

## Valuation Applications

### DCF Model Inputs
Use consensus estimates for:
- Year 1-3 revenue projections
- Margin assumptions (derive from EPS/Revenue)
- Growth rate benchmarks

### Comparable Analysis
Compare forward multiples:
- Forward P/E vs peers
- Forward P/S vs peers
- Relative to historical averages

### Earnings Expectations
For earnings trades:
- Identify consensus to beat/miss
- Track estimate revisions trend
- Compare to management guidance
