# Interpreting Balance Sheet Growth

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year | Total Assets Growth (%) | Total Liabilities Growth (%) | Shareholders' Equity Growth (%) | Cash & Cash Equivalents Growth (%) | Inventories Growth (%) |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 2025 | -1.57 | -7.31 | 29.47 | 12.01 | -21.52 |

**Positive values** = Growth vs prior year
**Negative values** = Decline vs prior year

## Key Patterns

### Deleveraging
When Liabilities Growth < 0 and Equity Growth > 0:
- Company reducing debt burden
- Strengthening financial position
- Often positive for credit ratings

### Leveraging Up
When Liabilities Growth > Assets Growth:
- Taking on more debt relative to assets
- Could be strategic (low rates, M&A) or concerning
- Check purpose of debt increase

### Cash Build
When Cash Growth significantly exceeds Assets Growth:
- Accumulating liquidity
- Preparing for acquisitions, buybacks, or uncertainty
- May indicate lack of reinvestment opportunities

### Working Capital Efficiency
When Inventories decline while business grows:
- Better supply chain management
- Reduced carrying costs
- Improved cash conversion cycle

## Balance Sheet Health Indicators

### Strong Position
- Equity growth outpacing Liabilities growth
- Cash position stable or growing
- Controlled inventory levels

### Warning Signs
- Liabilities growing faster than Assets for multiple years
- Cash declining while Liabilities increase
- Inventory buildup with slowing revenue
