## Key Observations Pattern

After receiving data, generate observations:

1. **Operating cash flow consistency**: Track OCF relative to Net Income
2. **Financing outflows**: Analyze buybacks and dividends
3. **Free cash flow capacity**: Assess cash generation strength
4. **Capital expenditure trends**: Derive from OCF minus FCF
5. **Cash position trajectory**: Monitor ending cash balance

## Metrics Reference

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Net Income | Bottom-line profit (starting point for OCF) |
| Operating Cash Flow | Cash from core business operations |
| Investing Cash Flow | Cash for/from investments and capex |
| Financing Cash Flow | Cash from/to debt and equity activities |
| Free Cash Flow | OCF minus capital expenditures |
| Net Change in Cash | Total cash change for the period |
| Cash at End of Period | Ending cash and equivalents balance |

## Analysis Tips

### Cash Conversion Quality
```
Cash Conversion = Operating Cash Flow / Net Income
```
- Above 1.0 = high quality earnings
- Consistently below 1.0 = potential concerns

### Capex Calculation
```
Capital Expenditures = Operating Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow
```
Example: $111.48B - $98.77B = $12.71B capex

### Shareholder Returns
Financing outflows typically include:
- Share repurchases (buybacks)
- Dividend payments
- Debt repayments

### Three-Statement Linkage
- Net Income flows from Income Statement
- Cash at End links to Balance Sheet
- Changes explain Balance Sheet movements

### Cash Flow Sustainability
Strong indicators:
- OCF consistently > Net Income
- FCF covers dividends and buybacks
- Positive ending cash trend

Warning signs:
- OCF declining while income grows
- FCF negative with continued buybacks
- Cash position eroding

## Follow-up Queries

Based on results, suggest deeper analysis:

- "Break down [COMPANY]'s financing cash flow between buybacks, dividends, and debt activity"
- "What is [COMPANY]'s capital expenditure trend and guidance for next year?"
- "Compare [COMPANY]'s free cash flow yield to [PEER1] and [PEER2]"
- "Analyze [COMPANY]'s working capital changes driving operating cash flow"
