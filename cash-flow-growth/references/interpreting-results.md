# Interpreting Cash Flow Growth

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year | Operating Cash Flow Growth (%) | Free Cash Flow Growth (%) | Net Cash Flow Growth (%) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2025 | -5.73 | -9.23 | 8.55 |

**Positive values** = Growth vs prior year
**Negative values** = Decline vs prior year

## Key Patterns

### Cash Flow Quality
When Operating Cash Flow Growth > Net Income Growth:
- Strong earnings quality
- Efficient working capital management
- Cash backing reported profits

### Free Cash Flow Strength
When Free Cash Flow Growth > Operating Cash Flow Growth:
- Declining capex intensity
- Transitioning from growth to harvest phase
- More cash available for shareholders

### Investment Mode
When Free Cash Flow Growth < Operating Cash Flow Growth:
- Increasing capital expenditures
- Investing in growth capacity
- Check if investments generating returns

### Financing Activity Impact
When Net Cash Flow differs significantly from OCF:
- Debt issuance/repayment activity
- Share buyback programs
- Dividend payments
- M&A transactions

## Cash Flow Health Indicators

### Strong Position
- Consistent positive OCF growth
- FCF growth matching or exceeding OCF
- Stable net cash flow trajectory

### Warning Signs
- Multiple years of OCF decline
- FCF persistently negative
- High volatility in all metrics
- OCF declining while Net Income grows (quality concern)

## Connecting the Three Statements

Cash flow connects to:

1. **Income Statement**: Net Income is starting point for OCF
2. **Balance Sheet**: Cash changes flow to balance sheet
3. **Working Capital**: Receivables, inventory, payables impact OCF

## Common Drivers of Cash Flow Changes

### Operating Cash Flow
- Revenue growth/decline
- Working capital efficiency
- Non-cash expense changes (D&A)
- Deferred revenue timing

### Free Cash Flow
- All OCF drivers plus
- Capital expenditure decisions
- Maintenance vs growth capex mix

### Net Cash Flow
- All FCF drivers plus
- Debt issuance/repayment
- Equity issuance/buybacks
- Dividend payments
