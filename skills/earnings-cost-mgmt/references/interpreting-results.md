# Interpreting Cost Management Results

## Understanding Cost Initiative Types

### Initiative Categories

| Category | Description | Typical Savings |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Workforce | Headcount reduction | 50-70% of total |
| Facilities | Real estate optimization | 10-20% of total |
| Technology | Infrastructure efficiency | 10-15% of total |
| Vendor | Supplier consolidation | 5-10% of total |
| Process | Operational improvement | 5-10% of total |

### Timeline to Realization

| Initiative Type | Announcement | Planning | Execution | Full Savings |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Layoffs | Immediate | 1-2 months | 3-6 months | 6-12 months |
| Facilities | Immediate | 3-6 months | 6-18 months | 12-24 months |
| Technology | Immediate | 6-12 months | 12-24 months | 24-36 months |

## Analyzing Workforce Actions

### Headcount Reduction Analysis

```
Example: Meta Layoff Analysis

Headcount Before: 87,000
Reduction Announced: 11,000 (13%)
Headcount After: 76,000

Cost Per Employee (fully loaded):
- Average Salary: $180K
- Benefits & Taxes: $50K
- Stock Comp: $100K
- Other (facilities, equipment): $20K
- Total: $350K

Gross Savings: 11,000 × $350K = $3.85B
Severance Cost: 11,000 × $100K = $1.1B
Net Year 1 Savings: $2.75B
Run-Rate Savings (Year 2+): $3.85B
```

### Workforce Metric Tracking

| Metric | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Trend |
|--------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| Headcount | 87K | 82K | 77K | 76K | Declining |
| Revenue/Employee | $1.1M | $1.2M | $1.3M | $1.4M | Improving |
| Comp as % Rev | 35% | 32% | 30% | 28% | Improving |

## Analyzing Facility Consolidation

### Real Estate Optimization

| Action | Description | Savings Type |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Lease Termination | Exit leases early | One-time charge, ongoing savings |
| Sublease | Monetize excess space | Partial offset |
| Downsizing | Smaller footprint | Ongoing savings |
| Remote-First | Reduce office need | Long-term savings |

### Facility Savings Calculation

```
Example: Office Consolidation

Current Footprint: 10M sq ft
Reduction: 3M sq ft (30%)
Avg Cost/sq ft: $60/year

Gross Savings: 3M × $60 = $180M/year

Charges:
- Lease Termination: $500M (one-time)
- Asset Impairment: $200M (non-cash)
- Total Charges: $700M

Payback: $700M / $180M = 3.9 years
```

### Operational Efficiency Categories

| Initiative | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Automation | Replace manual processes | Labor savings |
| Vendor Consolidation | Fewer suppliers | Better pricing |
| Procurement | Strategic sourcing | Cost reduction |

| Procurement Savings | Baseline | +8% | +$200M |

## Financial Impact Assessment

### P&L Impact Modeling

```
Income Statement Impact:

Revenue: $100B (unchanged)

Cost Reductions:
- Compensation: -$2.0B
- Facilities: -$0.5B
- Depreciation: -$0.3B
- Other OpEx: -$0.2B
- Total Savings: -$3.0B

One-Time Charges:
- Severance: $1.0B
- Lease/Asset: $0.5B
- Total Charges: $1.5B

Year 1 Impact: $3.0B - $1.5B = +$1.5B operating income
Year 2+ Impact: $3.0B operating income improvement
Margin Impact: +3pp
```

### Cash Flow Impact

Current Operating Margin: 25% → $25B operating income
After Cost Cuts: 33% → $33B operating income
Improvement: $8B

Valuation (15x multiple):
- Before: $25B × 15 = $375B
- After: $33B × 15 = $495B
- Value Creation: $120B (+32%)
```

## Next Steps After Analysis

1. **Validate savings** against actual results
2. **Track execution** quarter-over-quarter
3. **Benchmark to peers** for relative efficiency
4. **Model margin impact** for valuation
5. **Watch for trade-offs** in growth or quality
6. **Monitor sustainability** of cost reductions
