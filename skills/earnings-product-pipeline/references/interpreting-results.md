|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Manufacturing | Medium | Facility inspection |
| Labeling | Low | Negotiation |
| Additional data | High | New trial/analysis |
| Safety concern | Very High | Extensive work |

## Pipeline Stage Analysis

### Stage-by-Stage Assessment

| Stage | Key Questions | Risk Level |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Preclinical | Target validated? | Very High |
| Phase 1 | Safe? Dose found? | High |
| Phase 2 | Efficacy signal? | Medium-High |
| Phase 3 | Confirmed efficacy? | Medium |
| Regulatory | Approval likely? | Low-Medium |
| Approved | Commercial success? | Low |

### Probability of Success by Stage

```
Historical Success Rates:

Preclinical → Phase 1: 31%
Phase 1 → Phase 2: 52%
Phase 2 → Phase 3: 29%
Phase 3 → Approval: 58%
Regulatory → Approval: 85%

Cumulative from Phase 1: 9%
Cumulative from Phase 2: 17%
Cumulative from Phase 3: 49%

Adjust based on:
- Indication (oncology lower, rare disease higher)
- Prior data quality
- Competitive landscape
```

## Pipeline Valuation Framework

### Risk-Adjusted NPV Model

```

## Next Steps After Analysis

1. **Build catalyst calendar** for upcoming events
2. **Calculate pipeline value** for valuation
3. **Compare to peers** for competitive position
4. **Track quarter-over-quarter** for execution
5. **Monitor for updates** between calls
6. **Model scenarios** for key catalysts
