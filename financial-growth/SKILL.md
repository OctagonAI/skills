## Key Insights Pattern

After receiving data, generate insights:

1. **Peak performance years**: Identify years with highest growth across all metrics
2. **Earnings vs cash flow divergence**: Compare Net Income growth to FCF growth
3. **Margin trends**: Compare Gross Profit and Operating Income growth to Revenue
4. **EPS enhancement**: Note when EPS growth exceeds Net Income growth (buybacks)
5. **Challenging periods**: Flag years with broad-based declines

## Metrics Reference

| Metric | Definition |

| Revenue Growth | YoY change in total sales |
| Gross Profit Growth | YoY change in Revenue minus COGS |
| Operating Income Growth | YoY change in income from operations |
| Net Income Growth | YoY change in bottom-line profit |
| EPS Growth | YoY change in earnings per share |
| Free Cash Flow Growth | YoY change in operating cash flow minus capex |

## Analysis Tips

### Exceptional Growth Years
When all metrics show double-digit growth:
- Identify specific drivers (new products, markets, pricing)
- Assess sustainability of growth rate
- Compare to industry and competitors

### Earnings Quality Check
When Net Income Growth >> Free Cash Flow Growth:
- Potential working capital build
- Aggressive revenue recognition
- One-time items boosting earnings
- Investigate cash conversion

### Share Buyback Impact
When EPS Growth > Net Income Growth:
- Active share repurchase program
- Check shares outstanding trend
- Assess capital allocation priorities

### Margin Expansion
When Operating Income Growth > Revenue Growth:
- Operating leverage at work
- Cost discipline showing results
- Pricing power in action

### Contraction Periods
When multiple metrics decline:
- Identify root cause (demand, competition, costs)
- Check if industry-wide or company-specific
- Look for recovery signals in subsequent periods

## Follow-up Queries

Based on results, suggest deeper analysis:

- "What factors contributed to the significant [YEAR] growth spike?"
- "How did the [YEAR] downturn impact [COMPANY]'s long-term strategy?"
- "What explains the [YEAR] net income growth despite lower free cash flow?"
- "Compare [COMPANY]'s growth metrics to [PEER1] and [PEER2]"
