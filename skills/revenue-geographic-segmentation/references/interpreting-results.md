# Interpreting Revenue Geographic Segmentation Results

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year | Americas Segment | Europe Segment | Greater China Segment | Japan Segment | Rest of Asia Pacific Segment |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 2025 | $178,353.00M | $111,032.00M | $64,377.00M | $28,703.00M | $33,696.00M |

Values are in absolute USD (millions) for each fiscal year.

## Key Calculations

### Regional Share
```
Region % = Region Revenue / Total Revenue × 100
```
Example (2025): Americas = $178.4B / $416.2B = 42.9%

### Year-over-Year Growth
```
Region Growth = (Current - Prior) / Prior × 100
```
Example: Americas 2024-2025 = ($178.4B - $167.0B) / $167.0B = 6.8%

### CAGR (Multi-year)
```
CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Years) - 1
```
For long-term regional growth analysis.

## Key Patterns
