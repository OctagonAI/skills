5. **Recent events**: References to actual incidents or near-misses

### Lower Materiality Indicators

1. **Listed last**: Later position suggests lower priority
2. **Brief description**: Short, boilerplate language
3. **Generic wording**: Industry-standard disclosures

## Risk Quantification

### Explicit Quantification

When companies provide numbers:
- "Could result in losses up to $X million"
- "Represents X% of total revenue"
- "Affects X countries/regions"

### Implicit Assessment

When no numbers provided:
- Length of discussion = relative importance
- Specificity of examples = likelihood
- Mitigation discussed = management attention

## Building a Risk Matrix

### Probability Assessment

| Level | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| High | Specific incidents cited, active litigation |
| Medium | Industry-wide trends, regulatory changes |
