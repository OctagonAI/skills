# Interpreting Income Statement Results

## Reading the Output

| Fiscal Year | Revenue (USD) | Net Income (USD) | EPS (Diluted) |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| 2025 | $416,161,000,000 | $112,010,000,000 | 7.46 |

Values are in absolute USD (or local currency) for the fiscal period.

## Key Calculations

### Year-over-Year Change
```
Revenue Growth = (Current Year - Prior Year) / Prior Year × 100
```
Example: ($416B - $391B) / $391B = 6.4% growth

### Net Margin
```
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue × 100
```
Example: $112B / $416B = 26.9%

### Earnings Yield
```
Earnings Yield = EPS / Stock Price × 100
```
Inverse of P/E ratio
